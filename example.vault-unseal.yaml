# unseal tokens necessary to unseal any of the given vaults in the above node
# list.
#
# WARNING: do not put enough tokens in this list that can be used to unseal a
# vault instance. I.e. if vault requires 3 of 5 tokens, DO NOT PUT 3 TOKENS HERE.
# the goal is to put less than the required amount, but have more instances of
# vault-unseal setup with the other missing tokens from the list. this ensures
# that if the server was compromised, they don't have all of the needed tokens.
#
# i.e. 1 instance of vault-unseal on each of the three nodes, each with two
# tokens. given A, B, and C tokens required, each instance should have the
# following tokens:
#   * 1: AB
#   * 2: BC
#   * 3: AC

  - your-token
