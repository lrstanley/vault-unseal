## :grey_question: Why

HashiCorp Vault provides a few options for auto-unsealing clusters:

- [Cloud KMS (AWS, Azure, GCP, and others)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal/awskms) (cloud only)
- [Hardware Security Modules with PKCS11](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal/pkcs11) (enterprise only)
- [Transit Engine via Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal/transit) (requires another vault cluster)
- [Potentially others](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal)

However, depending on your deployment conditions and use-cases of Vault, some of
the above may not be feasible (cost, network connectivity, complexity). This may
lead you to want to roll your own unseal functionality, however, it's not easy to
do in a relatively secure manner.

So, what do we need to solve? We want to auto-unseal a vault cluster, by providing
the necessary unseal tokens when we find vault is sealed. We also want to make sure
we're sending notifications when this happens, so if vault was unsealed
unintentionally (not patching, upgrades, etc), possibly related to crashing or
malicious intent, a human can investigate at a later time (**not** 3am in the
morning).

## :heavy_check_mark: Solution

The goal for this project is to find the best way to unseal vault in a way that
doesn't compromise too much security (a good balance between security and ease of
use/uptime), without the requirement of Vault Enterprise, or having to move to a
cloud platform.

We do this by running multiple instances of vault-unseal (you could run one
on each node in the cluster). Each instance of vault-unseal is given a subset
of the unseal tokens. You want to give each node **just enough** tokens, that
when paired with another vault-unseal node, they can work together to unseal the
vault. What we want to avoid is giving a single vault-unseal instance enough
tokens to unseal (to prevent a compromise leading to enough tokens being exposed
that could unseal the vault). Let's use the following example:

![vault-unseal example diagram](https://cdn.liam.sh/share/2022/08/I8Qc1RCBMd.png)

Explained further:

- `cluster-1` consists of 3 nodes:
  - `node-1`
  - `node-2`
  - `node-3`
- `cluster-1` is configured with 5 unseal tokens (tokens `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`), but
     only 3 are required to unseal a given vault node.
- given there are 3 nodes, 3 tokens being required:
  - vault-unseal on `node-1` gets tokens `A` and `B`.
  - vault-unseal on `node-2` gets tokens `B` and `C`.
  - vault-unseal on `node-3` gets tokens `A` and `C`.

With the above configuration:

- Given each vault-unseal node, each node has two tokens.
- Given the tokens provided to vault-unseal, each token (`A`, `B`, and `C`), there
   are two instances of that token across nodes in the cluster.
- If `node-1` is completely hard-offline, nodes `node-2` and `node-3` should have
   all three tokens, so if the other two nodes reboot, as long as vault-unseal starts
   up on those nodes, vault-unseal will be able to unseal both.
- If `node-2` becomes compromised, and the tokens are read from the config
   file (note: vault-unseal **will not start** if the permissions on the file aren't
   `600`), this will not be enough tokens to unseal the vault.
- vault-unseal runs as root, with root permissions.

```
<!-- template:end:ghcr -->

### :toolbox: Source

Note that you must have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed (latest is usually best).

    git clone https://github.com/lrstanley/vault-unseal.git && cd vault-unseal
    make
    ./vault-unseal --help

## :gear: Usage

The default configuration path is `/etc/vault-unseal.yaml` when using `deb`/`rpm`.
If you are not using these package formats, copy the example config file,
`example.vault-unseal.yaml`, to `vault-unseal.yaml`. Note, all fields can be provided
via environment variables (vault-unseal also supports `.env` files).

```
$ ./vault-unseal --help
Usage:
  vault-unseal [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
  -v, --version          Display the version of vault-unseal and exit
  -l, --log-path=PATH    Optional path to log output to
  -c, --config=PATH      Path to configuration file (default: ./vault-unseal.yaml)

Help Options:
  -h, --help             Show this help message
```

## :ballot_box_with_check: TODO

- [ ] add option to use vault token/another vault instance to obtain keys (e.g. as long the leader is online)?
- [ ] memory obfuscating/removing from memory right after unseal?
